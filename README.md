## A fan-made set builder for Monster Hunter: Wilds

> This is a bit of a passion project that came into being just as Monster Hunter: Wilds launched at the beginning of March 2025. In the early days after the game's release, there were no apparent set builders that had all three of the requirements that I wanted: all of the current item data, a GUI for users to search and select items, and a final status sheet (even without all of the calculations like critical damage, effective raw (EFR) calculations, etc.) <br/> This project would not be nearly as feasible for a single contributor like myself without fantastic resources such as the Monster Hunter Wilds DB API. Please visit and give the contributors to that project your full support, as I do. Browse their <a href=https://github.com/LartTyler/MHWDB-API>GitHub</a> to view and support them there.

## **üìå Version Updates**

### **v 0.9.1 Current**
- Status page to display hunter stats such as **base true raw, base affinity, base defense, and base elemental resistances**.  
- Skill display to show **which armor skills (including set bonuses) are active**.  
- Toggle selection for conditional buffs such as Armor/Power Charm, consumable items, player/monster conditions (Agitator, Heroics, Maximum Might, etc.)

### **v 0.9.2 Development (Coming Changes)**
- Additional API functionality to provide **data for decorations**.  
- **Decoration manager**: Allow the use of slotting decorations in weapon and armor based on slots provided from equipped items.  
- **Integrate skills from decorations** to existing skills from weapon, armor, and charm/talisman.  

### **v 0.9.3 Development (Coming Changes)**
- Incorporate **additional conditional settings** such as monster state (enraged), max health (Peak Performance), max stamina (Maximum Might), health thresholds for Heroics, food, item consumables, etc.  
- Create and incorporate **arithmetic/logic functionality** to calculate stats such as:
  - Effective raw (EFR)
  - Conditional affinity
  - Effective critical damage (1.25 base multiplier)
  - Conditional buffs (Agitator, Maximum Might, etc.)
  - Consumables (Demon Powder, DemonDrug, etc.)
  - Food buffs 

### **v 0.9.0**
- Finished the base structure for selecting a weapon, each of the five slots for armor, and a charm (talisman).  
- The selection of both primary and secondary weapons persists after switching back and forth between the two.  
- Most primary formatting concerns should be largely acceptable for the time being; there will likely be revisions to color and font later for visually impaired users.  
- **All available item data** (thank you MHWDB-API) is available using API fetching.  
- Weapons and charms/talismans are populated on page load, while each specific type of weapon (i.e., each equippable Longsword) is only fetched and rendered when a weapon type is selected.
